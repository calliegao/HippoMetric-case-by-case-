**HippoMetric** is a lightweight and flexible Python-based toolkit for hippocampal shape modeling and subfield-level morphometric analysis from structural MRI data.

The toolkit provides:

- Anatomically informed hippocampal shape modelling corresponding to the Longitudinal Lamellar Organization of hippocampus
- Quantitative measurements of local morphometry: thickness, width, and length
- Reproducible workflows with batch processing and statistical-ready outputs 
- Seamless integration with FreeSurfer's recon-all segmentation pipeline

HippoMetric is designed for researchers in neuroimaging and computational anatomy, especially those interested in fine-grained hippocampal structural changes in conditions involving hippocampal damage.
